                    There are more custom items made by Phoenix , We will be releasing a tutorial soon™️<br>
                    You could refrain from using custom items , it is not necessary but just makes the game fun for people who think vanilla is boring.<br><br>
                    <h4>How do I link my account? Why should I link my account?</h4><br>
                    You need to DM @SlimeCraft Utility#2152 the code you get while joining the server to link your Minecraft account to your Discord account.<br>
                    You need to link your Minecraft account to your Discord account for the proper functioning of the proximity VC.<br><br>
                    <h4>How do I register? How do I login? Why do I have to register and login?</h4><br>
                    To register you have to do /register (password) (password).<br>
                    To login you have to do /login (password).<br>
                    Example<br>
                    - After linking my account and joining the server I do /register PhoenixIsCool PhoenixIsCool<br>
                    - The next time I join I don't have to register again BUT do /login PhoenixIsCool<br><br>
                    
                    Note - Keep a strong password because if someone knows your password he/she can login to the server through your account<br>
                    Another Note - Please remember your password<br>
                    You have to register and login for the security of your own account otherwise people can use your account and waste hours of your grind in seconds.

                    - Prefixed all item ID's so it does not cause errors with other plug-ins/add-ons!<br>

                    "Why?" You may ask.<br>
